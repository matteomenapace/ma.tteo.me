    <p>When I tell people that I make games, their first question is <em>Cool, where do I download them?</em> and then I say <em>Well, I don’t do videogames these days. I make boardgames…</em> and so they ask <em>Why?</em></p>
    <p>Because technology is powerful but it can be disempowering and alienating.</p>
    <p>Boardgames instead bring people together, in real life. At its core, a boardgame is a bunch of rules and roles that allow you to step out of your daily algorithms and play, explore, express yourself and learn together with other human beings.</p>
    <p class="margin-bottom-none"><strong>Boardgames are the original social media.</strong></p>
