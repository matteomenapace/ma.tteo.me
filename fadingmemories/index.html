        <!-- <h3>Do you also dread that moment when someone new asks you <em>‚Ä¶so, what do you do?</em></h3> -->
        <p>When I tell people that I make games, their first question is <em>Cool, where do I download them?</em> and then I say <em>Well, I don‚Äôt do videogames these days. I make boardgames‚Ä¶</em> and so they ask <em>Why?</em></p>
        <p>Because technology is powerful but it can be disempowering and alienating.</p>
        <p>Boardgames instead bring people together, in real life. At its core, a boardgame is a bunch of rules and roles that allow you to step out of your daily algorithms and play, explore, express yourself and learn together with other human beings.</p>
        <p class="margin-bottom-none"><strong>Boardgames are the original social media.</strong></p>

      <p>In 2018 I started a <a href="https://www.vam.ac.uk/blog/projects/people-who-make-games-were-once-people-who-never-made-a-game" target="_blank">game design residency</a> at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, excited to dig out boardgames to <strong>hack</strong> from the <a href="https://www.vam.ac.uk/moc/" target="_blank">V&A Museum of Childhood</a> collection.</p>
      <p>As I was studying those vintage games, one in particular caught my attention. It was a game that I played a lot as a kid.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="container">
      <h2>Memory</h2>
      <p><em>Memory</em> is considered an educational game because it teaches kids <em>recognition of matching forms and colours, to develop quick thinking</em>. But I find the <strong>moral of the game</strong> quite problematic, and revealing of the underlying values of our age. <em>Memory</em> pits you against other players and encourages you to hoard cards, keep quiet and exploit the mistakes of your fellow humans.</p>
      <p>I knew I wanted to hack <em>Memory</em> into a <strong>cooperative game</strong> but didn‚Äôt know quite how yet.</p>

      <p>Then around that time my <em>nonna</em> Rina died.</p>
      <p>She had struggled with dementia in her final years. We watched her memories dissolve, re-order and tangle themselves with one another. Trump yelling on TV would become <em>that awful guy from the next village.</em> It was sometimes painful, sometimes funny, often very strange.</p>

      <h2>Fading Memories</h2>
      <p>After the funeral I found myself scrolling through pictures of her, and landed on this one of <em>nonna</em> and I playing <em>Memory</em> together, just a few years ago.</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>üí≠ Ah, I have to make a game about this!</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>I grabbed blank cards and scribbled common family words like <span>MUM</span> <span>DAD</span> and <span>BROTHER</span> and verbs that evoke childhood activities like <span>PLAY</span> <span>LEARN</span> and <span>TALK</span>. Then I cut up sheets of tracing paper and covered them with the same words framed as questions.</p>

        <h3 class="margin-top-none">This game is about memory loss</h3>
        <p>But we are not competing with each other like in the original game. In this one <strong>all players work together</strong> to prevent memories from fading. How? By <strong>telling stories</strong>.</p>
        <p>This is how it works. Each time you flip two cards, you say ‚ÄúI remember‚Ä¶‚Äù and share a memory which revolves around the words on those cards.</p>
        <p>I called it <em>Fading Memories</em> because as soon as you share your story, it starts fading under layers of <em>memory loss</em> cards.</p>
        <p class="margin-bottom-none">This was my way to process the pain of watching <em>nonna</em> lose her ability to tell us the stories of her life, which used to make her so happy. Even when we were blatantly bored!</p>

      <p>Once I had a rough <strong>prototype</strong>, it was time to invite friends, friends of friends, and even unsuspecting visitors, into the V&A Residency Studio to <strong>playtest</strong> the game. Sharing snippets from their past over bowls of strawberries, crackers and humous. <!--Sketching dramatic scenes on my DIY chalkboard table. --> </p>

      <p>That‚Äôs when the magic happens. <em>Fading Memories</em> connects people and gives us permission to open up. Turn after turn, everyone gets a fair chance to be heard, and works together to build and maintain the collective memory.</p>
      <p>Imagine, would you talk to someone you literally just met about your childhood? Yet I‚Äôve watched people do just that while playing <em>Fading Memories</em>.</p>

      <p>Next, we needed artwork! I‚Äôve been working with <a href="https://www.instagram.com/aimee.today/" target="_blank">Aimee</a> my partner in life and crime, to develop the visual language for <em>Fading Memories</em>.</p>
      <p>Our challenge: how do you represent common words like <em>mum</em> or <em>dad</em>, which have super specific meanings for every person? Aimee produced abstract splashes of vibrant colours to evoke the emotional layer of our memories, without prescribing any particular image.</p>

      <p>We played around with many fancy fonts and they all looked slick, but also soulless. So I reluctantly tried my own handwriting <!--, and it just worked. Well, it didn‚Äôt <em>just work</em>, as the time-lapse video below shows. It took a few hours to develop a style I wasn‚Äôt repulsed by -->.</p>

      <p>We then got a small batch of decks printed in recycled cotton paper, and boxed them in recycled cardboard boxes.</p>

      <h2>We need more coop games</h2>
      <p><em>Fading Memories</em> is more than a deck of cards. For me, it‚Äôs one piece in a bigger puzzle.</p>
      <figure class="media-frame fixed" id="beta-cards">
        <!-- <img alt="" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*umpiiQWJ0GEU-ocbYkAcuQ.jpeg?q=20" width="3024" height="3024" role="presentation">

      <p>I want people to discover that there‚Äôs more to games than bankrupting your fellow players, or wiping out alien armies. We live in an age of extreme individualism, tech addiction and epidemic loneliness, in which the incarnation of <em>Mister Monopoly</em> is the US president.</p>
      <p>But we can make and play games that encourage collaboration, help us tackle tough questions and learn something new about each other.</p>
      <h2>Next time you catch up with your family and friends, try playing a cooperative game and create new memories!</h2>
