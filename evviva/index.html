      <p><em>Evviva</em> is a <strong>cooperative puzzle game</strong> for 1-many players.</p>
      <p>You play as a <strong>team of surgeons</strong>, working together to <strong>revive a strange patient</strong>. You will use square tiles to <strong>stitch up their organs, tissues and blood vessels</strong>.</p>
      <p>As you operate on your strange patient, they will suffer several <strong>haemorrhages</strong>, and they might even die of a <strong>heart attack</strong>. But if you manage to stitch up all the body tiles while keeping your patient alive, you all win!</p>

      <h1>Play</h1>
      <p>The player who was in a real operating theatre most recently takes the first turn. Play then proceeds clockwise.</p>

      <div class="callout">
        <p>On most turns you will do two things:</p>
        <p><strong>‚òùÔ∏è Draw 1 tile</strong>
          <br><strong>‚úåÔ∏è Place 1 tile</strong></p>
      </div>

      <p>Here is the full turn breakdown:</p>

      <h2>1. Top up your hand</h2>
      <p>Your <em>hand</em> is a set of face-up tiles from which you choose what to play.</p>
      <p>If your hand has less than 2 tiles, draw as many tiles from the deck as you need to have 2 face-up tiles.</p>
      <p>If you're playing with other people, you will share the same hand.</p>

      <h2>2. Place 1 tile</h2>
      <div class="grid two-columns">
        <div class="cell">

        <div class="cell">
          <p>Attach 1 tile from your hand to the body, making sure that:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>You attach at least one side of the new tile to the full side of a tile already in play.</li>
            <li>The features of each side you attach match the features of the side it joins.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>‚ö†Ô∏è In the rare case that none of the tiles in your hand can be legally placed, discard one of them, lose 1 heart point and draw another tile. Repeat this until you can legally place at least one tile from your hand.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

          <ul>
            <li>If the blood vessel has no open ends at this point, score 1 heart point for completing it (regardless of its length).</li>
          </ul>
          <p>If the closed side has an <strong>organ</strong>, check if all the organ parts are fully encompassed by a red membrane and there are no gaps within the organ. In that case, you completed the organ:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Remove the blood token from the organ.</li>
            <li>Score 1 heart point for each part of the organ you just completed (for example, a completed organ made of 4 parts will score 4 heart points).</li>

      <h2>Lose</h2>
      <p>You <strong>lose</strong> the game immediately if <em>any</em> of these three conditions are met at any point in the game:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong><em>Bled to death</em></strong> = your heart points drop to zero or below.</li>
        <li><strong><em>Clumsy surgeon(s)</em></strong> = you must add a drop token to the body but you have none left in the supply.</li>

      </ol>

      <h2>Win</h2>
      <p>If you manage to play all the tiles, then you <em>could</em> <strong>win</strong>. After you placed the very last tile from your hand (and opened/closed any wounds with it) trigger one last haemorrhage: count how many open wounds are left in the body, and lose that many heart points. If your heart score is above zero, the patient is still alive and you all <strong>win</strong> the game!</p>

      <h2>Your next game</h2>
      <p>Try starting with a number of heart points lower than 5, and/or playing with a number of drop tokens lower than 12 to make your next game harder.</p>
      <p>If instead you want an easier operation, start with more heart points and/or more drop tokens!</p>
