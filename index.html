        <h1>I am Matteo</h1> 

        <h2>I design and code Web products</h2>

        <p>I have been creating with computers since I was 3, using my dad’s work machine to make abstract drawings. And that’s what I still do, more or less: making abstract things with code.</p> 

        <p>Between then and now, I trained as a communication designer, taught myself how to program computers and made educational games for clients like the BBC.</p> 

        <p>I'm interested in hacking cultures, <i>critical making</i> and using data to create computational literature (aka <i>bots</i>).</p>

        <h4>Currently I teach people aged 7 to 60+ how to be creative with code.</h4>

        <p>You can read about my teaching philosophy at <a href="https://github.com/matteomenapace/tm">github.com/matteomenapace/tm</a> and follow me at <a href="https://twitter.com/baddeo">@baddeo</a>.</p>
