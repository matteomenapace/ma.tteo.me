      <p><span>PLAY</span> When I was a kid, I spent many afternoons playing videogames. A few years later, I learned to code so that I could hack together a game about ancient Greek philosophy. Then went on to build digital toys for the BBC and the Science Museum, and teach game design at universities around the UK.</p>

      <p><span>MAKE</span> As a grown-up, I’m still obsessed with games, but not your typical <i>kill-everyone-loot-everything</i> type game. I draw inspiration from social issues and current events to make games that provoke what I call <b>minimum playable dilemmas</b>.</p>

      <p><span>LEARN</span> I believe games have a huge expressive potential. They can make complex systems understandable, and <b>empower people to engage with tough questions</b>. It’s more than just <i>playing</i> games. We can have the most transformative learning experiences when we <i>make</i> games.</p>
