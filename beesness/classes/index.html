				<h3>If I say company away day or team-building afternoon, what comes to mind?</h3>
				<p>Greetings, presentations, paintballing, barbecuing?</p>
				<h4>Colleagues need to connect, but sometimes those activities seem disconnected.</h4>
				<p>What if exploring shared values as a team could be <strong>fun</strong> and <strong>purposeful</strong> at the same time? And no, I don‚Äôt mean volunteering to clean up the local park (although that‚Äôs a noble cause, but not an easy one to convince your team to embark on).</p>
				<h4>How about playing and making games for an hour, or an afternoon, or a day?</h4>
				<div class="image-frame">

				<h2 id="why-make">Why make games?</h2>

				<h4>Games are more than <em>just</em> fun.</h4>
				<p>They are a powerful medium because they let us step out of our (job) roles and immerse ourselves in a different world, with its own rules and roles. Unlike other media, as players we constantly make active choices: <strong>we shape the story, instead of just consuming it</strong>.</p>
				<p>Beyond solitary entertainment and power fantasies, games can make us think, help us learn and engage with complex questions, and <strong>problem-solve in a safe space where mistakes are free</strong>.</p>
				<p>Beyond zombies and space wars, we can <em>play</em> games about our reality. And we can <em>make</em> games about how we want to transform our reality.</p>

				<h4>Making games promotes empathy</h4>
				<p>A game doesn‚Äôt exist without players. Imagine making a game for (or <em>about</em>) another team in your organisation. When designing it, you will really have to get into their shoes, understand their challenges and their goals, then turn your understanding into a playable activity.</p>

				<h4>Making games fosters deep conversations</h4>
				<p>A game doesn‚Äôt have a fixed outcome. When the outcome depends on the choices of all players, you will naturally start discussing ideas, weighing alternatives, and making decisions together. This is super-charged when you become the game makers. </p>

				<h4>Making games stimulates systems thinking</h4>
				<p>A game is a bunch of rules. Rules defining how you can play, and rules describing how the <em>game world</em> will respond to you. When you are making the rules, you make that <em>world</em>. Whether the world is your organisation, your industry or a problem you're working on, you will model that as a <em>system</em>, identifying its moving parts and exploring the behaviours of its <em>actors</em>.</p>

				<h4>Making games gives teams agency and initiative</h4>
				<p>A game is a playable model of a complex system. When the system you are modeling is (part of) your business, the game becomes a tool for teams to explore ways to interrogate the system, and tweak how it works. Asking a lot of ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù questions, designing and testing solutions which could be applied in the real world.</p>

				</div>

				<h3 id="why-boardgames">Why board games?</h3>

				<h4>Making board games can be quick and simple</h4>
				<p>In a board game, there is no software that gets in the way. You are the <em>game engine</em>. You constantly process rules and check that other players are not cheating. This means that making a new board game can be as simple as agreeing to new rules between players.</p>
				<p>You don‚Äôt need to know how to code. No need to worry about <em>digital bugs</em>. All you need is paper-prototyping material and a curious mind.</p>

				<h4>Making board games is collaborative</h4>
				<p>Instead of working on a computer (a device designed for a single human) when making a board game all team members can throw ideas on the table, move pieces around and <em>think together</em>.</p>
